#' @title Generate spectrograms from labels
#' @description Generate spectrograms from recording labels for
#' classification purposes. The spectrogram parameters are user defined
#' and should be selected depending on the type of sound event to classify.
#' @param files_path Character. Path for the folder containing sound recordings.
#' @param update_progress Progress bar only to be used inside shiny.
#' @param db_path Character. Path for the database of recording labels created
#' with the shinny app provided in the package.
#' @param spec_size Integer. Spectrogram size in ms.
#' @param window_length Numeric. Moving window length in ms.
#' @param frequency_resolution Integer. Spectrogram frequency resolution with
#' higher values meaning better resolution. Specifically, for any integer X
#' provided, 1/X the analysis bandwidth (as determined by the number of samples
#' in the analysis window) will be used. Note that this greatly impacts
#' processing time, so adjust with care!
#' @param overlap Percentage of overlap between moving windows. Accepts values
#' between 0.5 and 0.75.
#' @param dynamic_range Threshold of minimum intensity values to show
#' in the spectrogram. A value of 100 will typically be adequate for the
#' majority of the recorders. If this is set to NULL, no threshold is applied.
#' @param freq_range Frequency range of the spectrogram. Vector with two values,
#' referring to the minimum and maximum frequency to show in the spectrogram.
#' @param tx Time expanded. Only used in recorders specifically intended for
#' bat recordings. Can take the values "auto" or any numeric value. If the
#' recording is not time expanded tx must be set to 1 (the default). If it's
#' time expanded the numeric value corresponding to the time expansion should
#' be indicated or "auto" should be selected. If tx = "auto" the function
#' assumes that sampling rates < 50kHz corresponds to
#' tx = 10 and > 50kHz to tx = 1.
#' @param seed Integer. Define a custom seed for randomizing data.
