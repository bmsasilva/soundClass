\usage{
auto_id(model_path, update_progress = NA, metadata,
file_path, out_file, out_dir, save_png = TRUE, win_size = 50,
plot2console = FALSE, remove_noise = TRUE, recursive = FALSE, tx = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_path}{Character. Path to the fitted model.}

\item{update_progress}{Progress bar only to be used inside shiny.}

\item{metadata}{The object created with the function spectro_calls()
containing the parameters used to fit the model.}

\item{file_path}{Character. Path to the folder containing recordings.}

\item{out_file}{Character. Name of the output file to save the results.
Will be used to name the csv file and the sqlite database.}

\item{out_dir}{Character. Path to the folder where the output results will
be stored.}

\item{save_png}{Logical. Should a spectrogram of the classified recordings
with the identified event(s) and respective classification(s) be saved
as png file?}

\item{win_size}{Integer. Window size in ms to split recordings in chunks
for classification. One peak per chunk is obtained and classified.}

\item{plot2console}{Logical. Should a spectrogram of the classified
recordings with the identified event(s) and respective classification(s)
be plotted in the console while the analysis is running?}

\item{remove_noise}{Logical. TRUE indicates that the model was fitted
with a non-relevant class which will be deleted from the final output.}

\item{recursive}{Logical. FALSE indicates that the recordings are in
a single folder and TRUE indicates that there are recordings
inside subfolders.}

\item{tx}{Only used in recorders specifically intended for
bat recordings. Can take the values "auto" or any numeric value. If the
recording is not time expanded tx must be set to 1 (the default). If it's
time expanded the numeric value corresponding to the time expansion should
be indicated or "auto" should be selected. If tx = "auto" the function
assumes that sampling rates < 50kHz corresponds to
tx = 10 and > 50kHz to tx = 1.}

\value{
Nothing.

\description{
Run automatic classification of sound events on a set of
recordings using a fitted model.
}
\details{

and saves the results of the analysis.
