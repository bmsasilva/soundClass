Title: Sound Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks

Description: Provides an all-in-one solution for automatic classification of 
    sound events using convolutional neural networks (CNN). The main purpose 
    is to provide a sound classification pipeline, from annotating sound events
    in recordings to training and automating model usage in real-life
    situations. Using the package requires a pre-compiled collection of 
    recordings with sound events of interest and it can be employed for: 
    1) Annotation: create a database of annotated recordings, 
    2) Training: prepare train data from annotatedrecordings and fit CNN models 
    and 3) Classification: automate the use of the fitted model for classifying 
    new recordings. By using automatic feature selection and a user-friendly GUI
    for managing data and training/deploying models, this package is intended 
    to be used by a broad audience as it does not require specific expertise in 
    statistics, programming or sound analysis.
