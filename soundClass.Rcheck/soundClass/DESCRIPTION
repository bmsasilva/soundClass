Description: All-in-one package for automatic classification
    of sound events using convolutional neural networks: manage and annotate large 
    acoustic datasets in order to create and deploy automatic AI classifiers for
    sound events based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). It provides 
    functionalities to annotate audio recordings and store information in database 
    format, pre-process data for model training purposes and to deploy a full 
    trained model to automatically classify sound events in new recordings. 
    By using automatic feature selection and a user-friendly GUI for managing data 
    and traing/deploying models, this package is intended to be used by a broad 
    audience as it does not require specific expertise in statistics, 
    programming or sound analysis.
